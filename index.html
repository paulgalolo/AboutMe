                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My Name is Paul Galolo, I am from Red Deer Alberta. This is my first semester studying computer science here at TRU, I did one semester of Computer Programming here at my Local College but decided to switch because i wanted to pursue a Bachelors instead of a 2-year diploma and i wanted to have a better chance at understanding computer science as well as getting a job in the future assuming AI isnt going to replace us, Knock on wood. I originally grew up in the Philippines but moved here in 2014 when i was nine years old. I have always been intrigued with technology ever since i was a kid but it was next to impossible because i come from a small province up north in The Philippines called "Batanes" which is known for tourism, great places and a old style living such as farming.

                    Growing up here in Canada i started to love the sport of American Football, I used to watch a lot of highlights of players when i was younger and fell in love with the Los Angeles Chargers specifically Keenan Allen. I have been a fan of the Chargers for about six to seven years now, We have gone through ups and downs but always will be a loyal fan to the Chargers. I love the Chargers to deat
