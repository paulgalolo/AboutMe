                <h1>I love Justin Herbert</h1>
                <p>Justin Herbert is the best Quarterback in the NFL obviously no bias in that, He is one of my
                    favorite players to watch right now. Every Sunday i wake up excited to watch him play, slinging the ball across the field. Out of all the Quartebacks that were drafted In 2020, He was by far my favorite out of all of them and this was before he was drafted. I had him Tua Tagovailoa from Alabama. Justin Herbert recently got a real headcoach to lead the team  to a potential superbowl.
                </p>

                <p>Justin Herbert Won the 2020 Offensive Rookie of the Year Award, even with a dissapoiting coaching staff whom had let him down, especially the defense who kept letting the other teams comeback and win the game. Herbert has gone through multiple coaches in both NFL and College though only two in the NFL, he has still managed to put up big numbers and win big games for the Chargers even with the setback.
